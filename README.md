# Roller-Coaster
Roller coasters are thrilling amusement park rides designed to make you squeal and scream! They take you up high, drop you to the ground quickly, and sometimes even spin you upside down before returning to a stop. 

Roller coasters are often split into two main categories based on their construction material: wood or steel. Rankings for the best wood and steel roller coasters from the 2013 to 2018 Golden Ticket Awards are provided in 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Wood.csv' and 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Steel.csv'
