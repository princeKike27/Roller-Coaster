# Roller-Coaster
For this project I analyzed data from the best ranked wooden and steel Roller Coasters in the world between 2013 to 2018. Roller Coasters are thrilling amusement park rides designed to make you squeal and scream! They take you up high, drop you to the ground quickly, and sometimes even spin you upside down before running to a stop. Roller Coasters are often split into two main categories based on their construction material: wood or steel.

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

* Data cleaning and standardization of suppliers names.
* Analysis of height, length and inversions of Roller Coasters.
* Does speed affect the length of a Roller Coaster?
* Roller Coaster seat type analysis.
* Analysis of the ranks of Roller Coasters over the years.
